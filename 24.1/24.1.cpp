	// they're all in reasonly predictable lines...
	// but I don't know how many lines there may be.

	// TODO: Now that I have the data scanned, I have to process it
	// sometimes this processing can occur during scanning 
	// but I don't think that's the case here.

	// TODO: The result now at hand, printf() it out.
